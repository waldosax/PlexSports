Despite facing a myriad of injuries, they have battled through all of them to maintain their position atop the Western Conference. Now that they are starting to get healthy again the Nuggets are rolling. Behind big performances from Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap and Gary Harris the Nuggets earned their fifth straight win in convincing fashion. The Charlotte Hornets played well and gave it their best effort but the Nuggets were too much and win this one going away 123-110.\r\n\r\nCoach Michael Malone elected to not mess with his starting unit, and brought the same group that he has for the past several weeks. The defense was there at the start, with Mason Plumlee stuffing Bismack Biyombo at the rim which led to a fast break three from Torrey Craig. The Hornets responded though, and we up to the task of keeping pace with Denver early on. Denver pushed ahead behind some early scoring by Jokic but their defense had become fairly non-existent and that let the Hornets come right back. Harris had a brilliant sequence where he cut for an easy hoop, then got a steal and buried a transition three but Denver just wasn\u2019t able to string together enough consecutive baskets to pull away even though they appeared to be on the edge of building a big lead at any point. Millsap had a strong close to the quarter and that was able to give the Nuggets a slight lead after one.",
