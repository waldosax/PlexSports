For this edition of the Rising Stars Challenge, a pool of the participating players was selected by the league's assistant coaches. Then, the teams were drafted by former NBA players and current TNT analysts Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley, who serve as \"General Managers\" for their respective teams. Former NBA player and current TNT analyst Kenny Smith served as the \"Honorary Commissioner\" for the Rising Stars Challenge. Sophomore Jeremy Lin of the New York Knicks and rookie Norris Cole of the Miami Heat were two last-minute additions to the player pool. Sophomore Derrick Favors of the Utah Jazz was selected as an injury replacement for Tiago Splitter. Lin played only nine minutes in the game, at his request, due to exhaustion from his rise to stardom that month.",

Kevin Durant scored 34 of his game-high 36\u00a0points in the first three quarters and was named the game's Most Valuable Player. LeBron James also scored 36. The West's lead was reduced to one point at 148\u2013147 after a Deron Williams' steal and layup with 1:44 remaining. Leading 151\u2013149, Blake Griffin secured the victory with a steal of a James' pass. Griffin was fouled and made one of two free throws with 1.1\u00a0seconds left. Kobe Bryant was guarding James on the pass and chastised James for not attempting a shot. Bryant left the game earlier in the third quarter after he was bloodied from a hard foul to his face by Dwyane Wade. He was diagnosed after the game with a broken nose and a concussion.",
