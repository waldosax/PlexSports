The West never led by more than eight points through the first three quarters, but they pushed the lead to double figures early in the fourth. Kobe Bryant blocked two shots by LeBron James late in the game, part of a late run to secure the game for the West. Kevin Durant led all scorers with 30 points and became the first player in NBA history to score 30+ points in three consecutive All-Star games, while Bryant had nine points and eight assists. Carmelo Anthony led the East with 26 points and 12 rebounds. James, who shot well during the latter part of the season's first half, shot only 7-for-18 while scoring 19 points.",
