It was the 57th edition of the NBA All-Star Game, and was played at New Orleans Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana, home of the New Orleans Hornets. The Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference, 134\u2013128. LeBron James was named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, his second time winning the award. This was the first NBA All-Star Game that was hosted by New Orleans, and was the city's first major professional sporting event (outside of regular season games) since the area was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The city was awarded in an announcement by commissioner David Stern on May 22, 2006. The other reported contenders for the 2008 contest was Air Canada Centre at Toronto, who withdrew the bid early in 2005.",

You Decide.\" For five minutes after the final round, polls were open on NBA.com and through SMS TXT and the dunker with the most votes at the end of the time limit was the winner.\nDwight Howard won the contest, grabbing 78% of fan votes."
