            "description": "Game notes\r\nThe Jazz social media site proclaimed Wednesday \"John Stockton Day\" because of the number worn by the Jazz great. \"It was fun watching him. If he was playing, I'd just be staring at him, and Karl (Malone),\" Popovich said before the game. Stockton holds the Spurs' opponent record for most assists in a game, with 28 at Salt Lake City on Jan. 15, 1991. Corbin said Stockton was one of the \"toughest competitors I played against and with as a teammate.\" Jazz CEO Greg Miller tweeted that he had a \"nice visit with Stockton on this 12-12-12\" and thanked him for all he's done. ... Jazz F Derrick Favors was back after missing the previous five games with plantar fasciitis in his right foot. He was averaging 9.3 points and 7.5 rebounds, and had a team-leading 32 blocks. He played (six minutes in the first half), and finished with six points and four rebounds.",
