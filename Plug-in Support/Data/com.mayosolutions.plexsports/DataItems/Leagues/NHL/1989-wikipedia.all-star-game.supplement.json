The game saw the team of all-stars from the Wales conference defeat the Campbell conference all-stars 12\u20137. The Montreal Canadiens were slated to host the 41st All-Star Game but withdrew their bid to considerations due to the hosting by Quebec City of Rendez-Vous '87. This had allowed the Penguins, who wanted to host an All-Star Game in 1993, to move up three years early.",
