The game featured the Chicago Blackhawks taking on the Boston Bruins at Notre Dame Stadium in Notre Dame, Indiana, home of the University of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish football team. This was the fourth Winter Classic for the Blackhawks (2009, 2015, 2017, sixth outdoor appearance overall and fifth in six years) and the third for the Bruins (2010, 2016). The game was the Bruins' first Winter Classic as the visiting team, and the first time the NHL hosted an outdoor game outside a team's immediate media market (Chicago, the host team, is in an adjacent media market to the South Bend market where Notre Dame is located).",
