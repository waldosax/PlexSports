                "description": "The 44th National Hockey League All-Star Game was the last NHL All-Star Game to take place at the Montreal Forum on February 6, 1993. Before the start of the Game, there was a tribute to Mario Lemieux, who was in attendance but could not play due to his treatments for Hodgkin's Disease. The Tampa Bay Lightning sent their first representatives to an All-Star Game. Mike Gartner would take Mark Messier's place in the All-Star lineup and ended up becoming the fourth player in All-Star history to score four goals in one game, earning All-Star MVP honours. The final score was Wales Conference 16, Campbell Conference 6.",
