The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots will play the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Atlanta Falcons to decide the league champion for the 2016 season.\r\n\r\nSuper Bowl LI is scheduled to be played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on Sunday, February 5, 2017. It will be the second Super Bowl to be held at NRG Stadium, the other being Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, which also featured the New England Patriots; and also the third time the Super Bowl has been played in Houston, after Super Bowl VIII in 1974 was held at Rice Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe event will mark the 50th anniversary year of the first Super Bowl, which was played on January 15, 1967. Super Bowl LI is the Patriots' ninth Super Bowl appearance, the most Super Bowl appearances of any team. It is also their second appearance in three years and their seventh under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Falcons are making their second appearance as a franchise and will have the chance to win their first Super Bowl, having lost in their only previous Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Super Bowl LI halftime show will be headlined by Lady Gaga.\r\n\r\nThe NFL selected the sites for Super Bowl 50 and Super Bowl LI at the owners' spring meetings in Boston on May 21, 2013. On October 16, 2012, the NFL announced that Reliant Stadium in Houston, which was renamed NRG Stadium in 2014, was a finalist to host Super Bowl LI. Houston then competed against the runner-up for the site of Super Bowl 50: Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. The South Florida bid for either Super Bowl partially depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations. However, on May 3, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a blow to South Florida's chances. The NFL ultimately selected Houston as the host city of Super Bowl LI.",
