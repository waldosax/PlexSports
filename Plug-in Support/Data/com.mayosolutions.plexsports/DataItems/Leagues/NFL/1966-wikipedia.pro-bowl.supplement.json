The game was played on January 22, 1967, in a heavy rainstorm at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California before a sparse crowd of 15,062. This was the second-lowest attendance in the history of the Pro Bowl next to the inaugural game in 1939. The final score was East 20, West 10. For the second year in a row, the East dominated the West on the strength of turnovers. They recovered two fumbles and intercepted four passes.",
