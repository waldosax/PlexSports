The final Score was NFC 17, AFC 3. Andre Rison of the Atlanta Falcons was the game's MVP. This was also Joe Montana's last Pro Bowl appearance (coincidentally, the coaches for this game were from both teams that Montana played for in his career: Kansas City's Marty Schottenheimer and San Francisco's George Seifert). The referee was Gordon McCarter.",
