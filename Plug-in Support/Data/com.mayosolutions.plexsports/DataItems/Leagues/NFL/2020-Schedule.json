With pending developments on the COVID-19 pandemic, the game is scheduled to be played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. This will be the fifth Super Bowl hosted by the Tampa area and the third held at Raymond James Stadium. It will be the fourth time that the Super Bowl was in the same state in back-to-back years, since Super Bowl LIV took place at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\r\n\r\nThis Super Bowl will mark three milestones, as Tampa Bay will be the first team to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium, Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady will play in his record 10th Super Bowl, and with COVID-19 health restrictions limiting stadium capacity to 22,000 fans, it will be the lowest attended Super Bowl.\r\n\r\nThe game will be televised nationally by CBS, with country music singer Eric Church and R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan performing the national anthem, while the halftime show will be headlined by Canadian singer the Weeknd.",
