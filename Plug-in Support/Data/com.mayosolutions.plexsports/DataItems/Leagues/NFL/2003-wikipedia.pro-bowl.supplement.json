                "description": "The AFC's first play set the tone for what would become a high-scoring affair. Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair faked a handoff to running back Jamal Lewis before throwing to Chad Johnson for a 90-yard touchdown pass, the third-longest scoring play in Pro Bowl history. After the NFC got the ball back, they were forced to punt after a three-and-out. However, the punt by Todd Sauerbrun was blocked, and Ed Reed of the Ravens recovered it and ran it into the end zone, giving the AFC a 14\u20130 lead early on. The NFC responded with a touchdown by Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander, and Jeff Wilkins kicked a field goal to bring the NFC to within four. After Mike Vanderjagt kicked a field goal of his own, the score at the end of the first quarter was 17\u201310 AFC. Peyton Manning came on for the AFC at the second quarter, and hit Colts teammate Marvin Harrison with a 50-yard strike, as well as another touchdown pass to Tony Gonzalez. Wilkins kicked another field goal for the NFC, and the halftime score was 31\u201313 in favor of the AFC.",
