                "description": "Before the start of the first inning, Alex Rodriguez voluntarily elected to switch to third base to allow Cal Ripken, Jr. to play at the shortstop position one final time at the All-Star Game, which the crowd gave a standing ovation. The move allowed Ripken to set the record for most MLB All-Star appearances at shortstop (15). Seattle's own Ichiro Suzuki gave his hometown fans something to cheer for early, when in the first, he singled off starter (and former Mariner) Randy Johnson, and then stole second. Johnson stranded him at second to hold the AL scoreless in the first inning. Ripken followed this with a home run in the third inning, which also got a standing ovation, to put the AL up 1\u20130.",
