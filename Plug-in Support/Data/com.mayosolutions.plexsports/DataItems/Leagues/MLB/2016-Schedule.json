The right-hander will fill the rotation spot of Bud Norris, who posted an 8.74 ERA in five starts this season. Foltynewicz's performance in Spring Training convinced the Braves that he could be more consistent than last year, when he had a 5.71 ERA over 18 appearances (15 starts) before a blood clot sidelined him in September. In four starts at Triple-A Gwinnett, Foltynewicz went 1-2 with a 2.05 ERA, but he walked at least four batters in three of his outings. The Mets will throw 42-year-old right-hander Bartolo Colon, who was 4-0 last season in five starts against the Braves. Colon will be taking his third crack at career win No. 220, which would move him past Pedro Martinez for sole possession of second place all-time among Dominican-born pitchers.",
