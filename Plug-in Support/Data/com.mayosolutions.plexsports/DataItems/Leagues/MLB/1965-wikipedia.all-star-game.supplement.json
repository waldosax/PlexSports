However, with the firing of 1964 Yankees manager Yogi Berra, and the resignation of '64 Cardinals manager Johnny Keane (who then managed the Yankees), the second place managers (Al L\u00f3pez of the White Sox and Gene Mauch of the Phillies) would manage their respective teams. In the National League, there had been a tie for second place, but Reds manager Fred Hutchinson had died in November 1964, making it unnecessary to break the tie.",
