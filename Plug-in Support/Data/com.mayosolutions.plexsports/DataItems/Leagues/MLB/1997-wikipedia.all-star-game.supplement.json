No one would score after that until the 7th inning when Javy L\u00f3pez of the Atlanta Braves would tie the game with a home run of his own. However, in the bottom of the 7th, Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees walked and then Sandy Alomar, Jr. of the Cleveland Indians hit a home run to give the American League the lead and the win, as they held on to defeat the National League 3-1. All the runs were driven in and scored by players either born (Alomar, L\u00f3pez & Williams) or raised (Martinez) in Puerto Rico. Winning pitcher Jos\u00e9 Rosado's family roots are also from that island.",
