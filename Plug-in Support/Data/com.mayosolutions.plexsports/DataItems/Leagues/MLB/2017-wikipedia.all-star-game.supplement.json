After a two-out double by Jonathan Schoop, Miguel San\u00f3 finally got the AL on the board with his fifth inning RBI bloop single. In the bottom of the sixth, Yadier Molina became the oldest catcher to hit a home run in an All-Star game, when he hit one off Ervin Santana in the sixth inning, tying the game at one. Reggie Smith was the last Cardinal to hit an All-Star Game home run in the 1974 game. Robinson Can\u00f3 hit the game-winning home run in the tenth inning off Wade Davis, and was named the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. He is the first second baseman since 1998 who was named All-Star Game MVP. Andrew Miller struck out Cody Bellinger swinging to end the night and earned his first career All-Star save.",
