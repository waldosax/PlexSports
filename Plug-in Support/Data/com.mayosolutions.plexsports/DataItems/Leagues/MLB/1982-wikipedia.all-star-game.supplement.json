Dave Concepci\u00f3n responded for the NL with a two-run homer in the second off AL starter Dennis Eckersley and the NL never looked back. The NL tacked on a run in the third when Ruppert Jones tripled and Pete Rose hit a sacrifice fly. The NL got their final run in the sixth on a Gary Carter RBI single that scored then-Expo teammate Al Oliver.",
