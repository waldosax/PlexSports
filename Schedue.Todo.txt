Schedule idiosyncracies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Disagreement. Event found, but not sourced by all
Duplicates.
	Events found for same team, same day, not double-headers.
		Time off more than an hour
		Game indicator mismatches (Double-Header vs. tournament)
	Home & Away reversed. Verify Source.
	Double-Headers in sports that don't belong (NFL, NBA?-bubble)
Time offset. Events found, but agreement is off by number of hours. Verify source.
Missing data (gaps)
	NHL API 2004 season
	ESPN API (NHL) 2006 Season
Data in wrong season
	ESPN API (NFL) 2022 season has 2021 preseason events
Games that are scheduled, but never played
	2020 World Series, Game 7
Spring Training Exhibitions are marked as regular season
Unrecognized teams showing up in wrong league?
	NFL: WSH returns Washington Senators
Subseason not identified.
	NFL Preseason games crossing the GMT date boundary
Games that have been rescheduled or cancelled (Not just MLB)
(Hockey: Las Vegas Knights LV or VEG? - SportsDataIO) VGK!!!
Trashbucket: NFL Post-season rounds:
	< 18: round = Week
	18: Wildcard
	19: Division
	20: Conference
	200: Superbowl
Trashbucket ambiguous times:
	NFL:
		["dateEvent"] = "2021-01-17"
		["strTime"] = "8:05"	<-- GMT
	MLB:
		["dateEvent"] = "2007-03-01"
		["strTime"] = "1:05"	<-- EST PM
		
		["dateEvent"] = "2007-03-01"
		["strTime"] = "12:05"	<-- EST PM
	NBA:
		["dateEvent"] = "2017-09-30"
		["strTime"] = "8:30 PM ET"	<-- parse goofy shit like strTimeLocal. ParseISO8601Date kinda did it, just didn't recognize the tz, which is the point
	NHL:
		N/A
Games on Tuesdays, Wednesdays?
